This website contains supplemental materials made by the TF, Jiawei Zhuang. 
These materials are **not required** for completing this course, 
but just provide additional information I find useful. Might also use them for the session.
Your grade will **not be affected** if you choose to ignore this website.

Homework Notes

Lecture & Session Notes
-----------------------

Forget the coding exercises in the class? The following notes might help.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   lecture2_logics_fib.ipynb
   lecture4_float.ipynb
   lecture5_complex.ipynb
   lecture6_matrix.ipynb
   session1_functions.ipynb
   session2_vectorization.ipynb

These notes combine codes and results together. You can just copy the codes to your MATLAB console or script.

If you wonder how I wrote codes in this format and want to try it yourself, see the section below.

MATLAB in Jupyter Notebooks
---------------------------

This course is taught in MATLAB. One thing you could try is to run MATLAB codes in `Jupyter Notebooks`_.
Jupyter Notebook is a must-learn tool for data scientists, and it is also becoming popular in the traditional
scientific computing community. 
It is a great tool for interactive computing and 
allows you to combine codes, simulation results, and descriptions such as latex equations in a single file. 

See how to install and use it at:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   jmatlab_install.ipynb
   jmatlab_use.ipynb

Some basic understanding of Linux command line and Python will be useful for installation. 
**If you are just new to programming, you should simply use MATLAB's original, basic user interface
and come back to this tutorial later when you are interested.**

If you feel good about this tool, you can choose to submit notebooks for your homework, 
Again, **your grade will not be affected by the file format of your homework**.
